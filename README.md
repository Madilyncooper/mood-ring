## $\mathsf{\color{Green}{UX}}$

This website is designed with the user in mind. We added links to fun quotes and random photos generated by clicking a color button. We chose a dark bubbly background to maintain a clean solid color but also add a bubbly effect! Depending on what mood you're feeling or if you just want to select a random color there are hundreds of photos and quotes created for your personal use! It allows the user to have multiple colors to chose from that will make them laugh at a quote to brighten their mood! The user can also navigate to the Mood Tracker page to see how much they have chosen a specific color.
