## $\mathsf{\color{Orange}{Project\ Overview}}$

We created an interactive application that includes two server-side APIs, a CSS framework, local storage, and a deployed link to GitHub Pages. In addition to receiving a fun quote and pictures correlated to the selected color, the application allows the user to navigate the application easily.

## $\mathsf{\color{Green}{UX}}$

This website is designed with the user in mind. We added links to fun quotes and random photos generated by clicking a color button. We chose a dark bubbly background to maintain a clean solid color but also add a bubbly effect! Depending on what mood you're feeling or if you just want to select a random color there are hundreds of photos and quotes created for your personal use! It allows the user to have multiple options to choose from or even laugh at a quote to brighten their mood!
